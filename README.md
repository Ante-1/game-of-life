# Game of Life

A Game of Life implementation in Java with the Spring Framework on the backend and a simple HTML+JS frontend to learn more about Spring. It has a file-based database that makes it possible to save patterns and run them again later. The calculations could be made in the frontend but are moved to the backend to learn more about Spring.


## Usage

```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Open http://localhost:8080 in your Browser
